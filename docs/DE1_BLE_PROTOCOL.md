# DE1 BLE Protocol Specification

This document describes the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol used to communicate with the Decent Espresso DE1 machine. This is reverse-engineered from the Tcl codebase and intended as a reference for alternative client implementations.

## Overview

The DE1 machine exposes a BLE GATT service. The tablet app:
1. Connects and subscribes to notifications
2. Uploads espresso profiles (frames) and settings
3. Sends state commands to trigger operations
4. Receives real-time shot data during extraction
5. Implements stop-at-weight using a connected scale

## Number Formats

The protocol uses fixed-point numbers to fit values in fewer bytes:

### U8P4 (8-bit, 4 fractional bits)
- Range: 0 to 15.9375
- Encode: `round(value * 16)`
- Decode: `byte / 16.0`
- Used for: pressure (bar), flow (mL/s)

### U8P1 (8-bit, 1 fractional bit)
- Range: 0 to 127.5
- Encode: `round(value * 2)`
- Decode: `byte / 2.0`
- Used for: temperature (°C)

### U16P8 (16-bit, 8 fractional bits)
- Range: 0 to 255.996
- Encode: `round(value * 256)`
- Decode: `value / 256.0`
- Used for: precise temperature

### F8_1_7 (custom float for duration)
- If value < 12.8: encode as `round(value * 10)` (0.1s precision)
- If value >= 12.8: encode as `round(value) | 0x80` (1s precision, set high bit)
- Decode: if high bit clear, `byte / 10.0`; else `byte & 0x7F`

### U10P0 (10-bit integer with flag)
- Encode: `round(value) | 1024`
- Decode: `value & 1023`
- Used for: volume limits

## Espresso Profiles

Profiles define how espresso extraction progresses. Only espresso uses the frame system; steam/water use simple settings.

### Profile Header (5 bytes)

Write to `HeaderWrite` (A00F):

```
Byte 0: HeaderV           - Always 1
Byte 1: NumberOfFrames    - Total frames (1-10)
Byte 2: NumberOfPreinfuseFrames - Frames before pour timing starts
Byte 3: MinimumPressure   - U8P4, minimum allowed pressure in flow mode
Byte 4: MaximumFlow       - U8P4, maximum allowed flow in pressure mode
```

### Profile Frame (8 bytes)

Write to `FrameWrite` (A010), one per frame:

```
Byte 0: FrameToWrite      - Frame index (0-9), or 32+ for extension frames
Byte 1: Flag              - Bitfield (see below)
Byte 2: SetVal            - U8P4, target pressure or flow
Byte 3: Temp              - U8P1, target temperature
Byte 4: FrameLen          - F8_1_7, frame duration in seconds
Byte 5: TriggerVal        - U8P4, exit condition threshold
Bytes 6-7: MaxVol         - U10P0, max volume before exit (0 = no limit)
```

### Frame Flags (bitfield)

| Bit | Mask | Name | Meaning when set |
|-----|------|------|------------------|
| 0 | 0x01 | CtrlF | Flow control mode (else pressure) |
| 1 | 0x02 | DoCompare | Enable exit condition |
| 2 | 0x04 | DC_GT | Exit if > threshold (else <) |
| 3 | 0x08 | DC_CompF | Compare flow (else pressure) |
| 4 | 0x10 | TMixTemp | Target mix temp (else basket temp) |
| 5 | 0x20 | Interpolate | Ramp smoothly (else instant jump) |
| 6 | 0x40 | IgnoreLimit | Ignore min pressure/max flow limits |

### Exit Condition Types

**Machine-side exits** (encoded in frame flags, DE1 checks autonomously):
- `pressure_over`: DoCompare + DC_GT
- `pressure_under`: DoCompare only
- `flow_over`: DoCompare + DC_GT + DC_CompF
- `flow_under`: DoCompare + DC_CompF

**App-side exits** (NOT encoded in BLE, app must monitor and send SkipToNext):
- `weight`: App monitors connected scale and sends `SkipToNext` (0x0E) when threshold reached

**IMPORTANT**: Weight exits are independent of the `DoCompare` flag. A frame can have:
- Machine exit disabled (`DoCompare = 0`) but weight exit active
- Both machine exit AND weight exit active simultaneously
- The DE1 has no knowledge of scale weight - only the app can trigger weight-based frame skips

### Extension Frames

For additional limits (max flow during pressure mode, etc.), send extension frames with `FrameToWrite = original_frame_index + 32`:

```
Byte 0: FrameToWrite      - Original index + 32
Byte 1: MaxFlowOrPressure - U8P4, limit value
Byte 2: MaxFoPRange       - U8P4, acceptable range
Bytes 3-7: Padding        - Zero
```

### Tail Frame

After all frames, send a tail frame:

```
Byte 0: FrameToWrite      - NumberOfFrames (next index)
Bytes 1-2: MaxTotalVolume - U10P0, max total shot volume
Bytes 3-7: Padding        - Zero
```

### Example: 3-Frame Profile

```
Header: 01 03 01 00 60
  HeaderV=1, 3 frames, 1 preinfuse frame, MinPressure=0, MaxFlow=6.0

Frame 0 (Preinfusion): 00 2E 40 BA 64 28 00 00
  Flag=0x2E (DoCompare|DC_GT|DC_CompF|Interpolate)
  SetVal=4.0 bar, Temp=93°C, FrameLen=10s
  TriggerVal=2.5 mL/s (exit if flow exceeds), MaxVol=0

Frame 1 (Ramp): 01 20 90 B8 32 00 00 00
  Flag=0x20 (Interpolate)
  SetVal=9.0 bar, Temp=92°C, FrameLen=5s
  No exit condition

Frame 2 (Pour): 02 00 90 B8 C8 00 00 00
  Flag=0x00 (pressure mode, no exit, instant)
  SetVal=9.0 bar, Temp=92°C, FrameLen=20s

Tail: 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

## Steam/Hot Water Settings

Write to `ShotSettings` (A00B), 9 bytes:

```
Byte 0: SteamSettings     - Flags (reserved)
Byte 1: TargetSteamTemp   - U8P0, steam temperature °C
Byte 2: TargetSteamLength - U8P0, max steam time seconds
Byte 3: TargetHotWaterTemp - U8P0, hot water temperature °C
Byte 4: TargetHotWaterVol - U8P0, hot water volume mL
Byte 5: TargetHotWaterLength - U8P0, max hot water time seconds
Byte 6: TargetEspressoVol - U8P0, typical espresso volume (for display)
Bytes 7-8: TargetGroupTemp - U16P8, group head temperature °C
```

## Real-Time Shot Data (ShotSample)

Subscribe to notifications on `ShotSample` (A00D). Received at ~5Hz during operations:

The data contains:
- Current pressure
- Current flow rate
- Mix temperature
- Head temperature
- Current profile frame number
- Cumulative volume dispensed
- Shot timer value

(Exact byte layout requires further reverse engineering of `update_de1_shotvalue` in the codebase)

## Memory-Mapped Registers (MMR)

For advanced configuration, use `ReadFromMMR` (A005) and `WriteToMMR` (A006).

### MMR Read Request (20 bytes)
```
Byte 0: Len              - Data length in words-1 (0=4 bytes, 1=8 bytes)
Bytes 1-3: Address       - 24-bit address (big endian)
Bytes 4-19: Data         - Unused for read requests
```

### MMR Write Request (20 bytes)
```
Byte 0: Len              - Data length (typically 0x04)
Bytes 1-3: Address       - 24-bit address (big endian)
Bytes 4-19: Data         - Data to write (little endian integers)
```

## Scale Integration

Scales are separate BLE devices. Each brand has its own service/characteristic UUIDs:

### Decent Scale
- Service: `0000FFF0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Read: `0000FFF4-...`
- Write: `000036F5-...`

### Acaia Pyxis/Lunar
- Service: `49535343-FE7D-4AE5-8FA9-9FAFD205E455`
- Status (notify): `49535343-1E4D-4BD9-BA61-23C647249616`
- Command (write): `49535343-8841-43F4-A8D4-ECBE34729BB3`

**Protocol Commands** (all prefixed with `EF DD`):
| Type | Command | Payload | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `0x00` | Heartbeat | `02 00 02 00` | Keep-alive, send every 3s |
| `0x04` | Tare | 17 zero bytes | Zero the scale |
| `0x0B` | Ident | `30 31 32...` + checksum | Initial handshake |
| `0x0C` | Config | `09 00 01 01 02 02 01 03 04 11 06` | Enable weight notifications |

**Connection Sequence:**
1. Connect and discover services
2. Enable notifications on Status characteristic
3. Send Ident command, retry until scale responds
4. Send Config command once
5. Wait for first weight notification → mark as connected
6. Start heartbeat timer (3s interval)

**Important:** Config is only sent during init. Once weight data is flowing, only heartbeats are needed to maintain connection.

### Acaia IPS (older Lunar/Pearl)
- Service: `00001820-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Characteristic: `00002A80-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Uses WriteWithoutResponse (unlike Pyxis which uses WriteWithResponse)

### Felicita
- Service: `0000FFE0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Characteristic: `0000FFE1-...`
